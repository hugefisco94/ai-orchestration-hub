GPT-4o because that’s what they started with. Claude because someone on Twitter said it writes better. Gemini because they’re on GCP. DeepSeek because the pricing is genuinely insane.\nWhat almost nobody has is a model tier opinion. That’s the actually important decision.\nClaude Haiku and Claude Opus are not the same model with different price tags. GPT-4o and o3 are not the same model with different speeds. Gemini Flash and Gemini Pro are not the same model with different budgets. They have genuinely different personalities, different failure modes, and different jobs to do. Picking the wrong tier is like hiring a senior architect to write your README. Technically capable, completely wrong for the task.\nSo I put them all on one map.\nTwo axes: reasoning depth (how hard does it actually think?) vs. speed and cost (how fast and cheap is it to run at scale?). Every major tier from every major lab, plotted on the same grid.\nI made a 2x2. I spent years in PE doing due diligence, and a good 2x2 is load-bearing infrastructure for how I think. Bear with me.\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n![] \nInteractive version + HTML download in the ocmments :)## Top Left: High Depth, Low Cost — Your Daily Drivers\nThis is the most important quadrant on the map. These models punch above their weight class, genuinely capable of deep reasoning without the pricing of the specialist tier. For most seed-stage companies, everything you build should live here first.\n## Claude Sonnet 4.6 — The Anchor\n70% of developers now prefer Sonnet 4.6 over its predecessor, and 59% prefer it over the previous generation’s Opus. That stat should reframe how you think about the whole map. A Sonnet is now beating an Opus in real-world preference, which means the sweet spot has migrated down the cost curve.\nThe personality: the colleague you’d actually want to work with. Capable of depth when you ask for it, capable of brevity when you don’t. The over-caveating of earlier Claude generations has mellowed. It knows when to shut up and just answer. Default to this for 80% of your production use cases.\n**Best for: **Code generation, complex analysis, long-form writing, agentic workflows.\n**Watch out for: **Tasks that genuinely need 1M token context or the highest level of multi-agent orchestration. That’s Opus territory.\n## Gemini 3 Flash — The Wildcard\nHere’s the stat that caught everyone off guard when Google dropped Gemini 3 Flash in December 2025: it scores 78% on SWE-bench coding benchmarks. Gemini 3 Pro scores 76.2%. The cheaper, faster model beat the expensive one at coding. Google called this a feature. The internet called it embarrassing for Pro. I call it useful information for founders.\nFlash is fast. Genuinely faster than anything else at frontier quality and priced at $0.50 per million input tokens, which makes it 6x cheaper than Sonnet and dramatically cheaper than anything in the specialist tier. For latency-sensitive applications or high-volume pipelines where cost compounds, Flash deserves serious evaluation. The multimodal capabilities are real, the Google ecosystem integration is deep, and for coding-heavy workflows specifically, it may outperform models that nominally sit above it.\n**Best for: **Real-time applications, high-volume inference, coding pipelines, anything deeply integrated with Google Workspace or GCP.\n**Watch out for: **Factual accuracy on obscure topics. Flash reports \\~72% on SimpleQA, which means confident hallucinations are a real risk on niche queries.\n## DeepSeek V3.1 — The Efficiency Argument Made Flesh\nDeepSeek trained a model that matches GPT-4o on most benchmarks for approximately $5.9 million in total compute (oooo shpooky). OpenAI reportedly spent north of $100 million training GPT-4. That’s not a rounding error. It’s an entirely different theory of how AI development works.\nV3.1 sits here because it combines genuine reasoning capability with pricing that is, frankly, absurd. At current rates it runs 140x cheaper than OpenAI o1 for equivalent output tokens. For high-volume, cost-sensitive inference where you’ve validated quality, this is hard to ignore.\nThe elephant in the room: all data routes through servers in China. That’s DeepSeek’s stated policy. For founders in healthcare, fintech, legal, or any enterprise-sales context, this is a procurement conversation you will have and you need an answer. The open-source MIT license is the workaround. Run the weights locally or on your own cloud and the data concern evaporates entirely.\n**Best for: **High-volume technical inference where cost is the primary constraint and data residency is either non-sensitive or self-hosted.\n**Watch out for: **Any regulated vertical, any enterprise sales process with a security questionnaire, and any task requiring real-time internet access. It’s text-only.\n## Top Right: High Depth, High Cost — The Specialists\nThese are not daily drivers. They’re what you reach for when the stakes are high and speed is secondary. Architecture decisions, security analysis, financial modeling, anything where a confident hallucination could cause real damage. Think of this quadrant as the senior partner tier: bring them in for the hard meeting, not the daily standup.\n## Claude Opus 4.6 — The Senior Partner\nOne million token context window. Native multi-agent coordination. The ability to hold an entire large codebase in context and reason about it coherently. Opus is Anthropic’s answer to the question of what happens when you genuinely need more horsepower.\nThe pricing reflects the positioning at $5 per million input tokens, meaningfully more than Sonnet. The question isn’t whether Opus is good. It clearly is. The question is whether your use case actually warrants it. In my experience doing technical due diligence, most seed-stage teams reach for Opus when Sonnet would do fine. Same instinct that makes teams build microservices when a monolith works perfectly well.\n**Best for: **Massive context tasks, multi-agent orchestration, complex reasoning where Sonnet has already failed.\n**Watch out for: **Premature optimization. Try Sonnet first.\n## OpenAI o3 / o4-mini — The Models That Actually Think\nThe o-series is where OpenAI made a genuinely different architectural bet. These models use simulated reasoning. They pause, chain thoughts together, and work through problems before responding. The result is slower than GPT-4o but dramatically more accurate on hard problems: 88.9% on AIME math, 83.3% on PhD-level science benchmarks.\nThe personality is categorically different from the GPT family. Where GPT-4o is warm and conversational, o3 is deliberate and analytical. Ask it a trick question and it will identify the trap before answering. GPT-4o will answer confidently and incorrectly. For tasks where being wrong has consequences, that difference matters a lot.\no4-mini deserves special mention: it’s the sweet spot for technical founders. Outperforms o1 on coding, 92.7% on math benchmarks, faster and cheaper than full o3. If you’re building anything STEM-heavy, start here before reaching for o3.\n**Best for: **Complex reasoning, security analysis, financial modeling, code review, anything where accuracy trumps speed.\n**Watch out for: **Real-time or conversational applications. Users notice the latency.\n## Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Think — Google’s Specialist\nGemini 3 Pro’s real differentiation isn’t reasoning depth in isolation. It’s the combination of reasoning depth and multimodal capability. If your use case involves processing images, video, audio, and long documents together, Pro is doing things the other specialist-tier models can’t match.\nDeep Think mode, available to Ultra subscribers, is Google’s direct answer to the o-series: extended chain-of-thought reasoning for the hardest problems. The 1M token context window is real and useful. The Google Workspace and GCP integration is genuinely deep for teams already in that ecosystem.\nThe slightly inconvenient benchmark truth: Flash beats Pro on coding (78% vs 76.2% on SWE-bench). So if you’re reaching for Pro specifically for coding, Flash is probably the right answer. Pro earns its place for multimodal depth and extremely long context tasks.\n**Best for: **Multimodal workflows, very long context processing, teams deep in the Google ecosystem.\n**Watch out for: **Pure coding tasks. Flash actually wins there.\n## DeepSeek R1 — Open-Source Reasoning at a Fraction of the Cost\nR1 is DeepSeek’s reasoning model, their answer to the o-series, and it’s genuinely impressive. It outperformed OpenAI o1 on AIME 2024 (96.3% vs 79.2%). It’s MIT licensed, meaning you can download the weights, modify them, run them locally, and deploy them commercially. At current API pricing it’s over 100x cheaper than o1 for equivalent output.\nThe open-source angle is R1’s real superpower. Run the 70B distilled version locally and you get most of R1’s reasoning capability with none of the data residency concern. Nothing leaves your machine. For founders in regulated verticals who want reasoning-model capability without the compliance headache, this is a serious option that most people aren’t evaluating properly.\n**Best for: **Hard reasoning tasks, math-heavy builds, regulated industries willing to self-host, anyone who wants o1-level capability at a fraction of the cost.\n**Watch out for: **The full 671B model requires serious hardware (8x H200 GPUs). The distilled versions are more accessible but trade some capability.\n## Bottom Left: Low Depth, Low Cost — The Volume Workhorses\nThese models exist for one reason: scale. You’ve already validated quality with a smarter model. Now you need to run millions of requests per day without your AWS bill becoming your primary investor concern.\n## Claude Haiku 4.5 — The Executor\nHaiku is the fastest, cheapest Claude. At roughly $1 per million input tokens, it’s Anthropic’s answer to high-volume, cost-sensitive inference. The personality: eager, quick, capable of impressive things in short bursts, but it loses the thread. Give it a 10,000-word document and a complex multi-step task and it starts to drift. Not because it’s dumb. Because it has the working memory of someone who’s been awake for 36 hours.\nThe intended use in a multi-agent system: Sonnet makes the plan, Haiku carries it out in parallel at scale. That’s a real pattern that works.\n**Best for: **Agentic subtasks, triage, classification, UI scaffolding, anything you’re calling thousands of times per day.\n**Watch out for: **Long context, sustained coherence, anything where drift is dangerous.\n## GPT-4o / GPT-4o mini — The Generalists\nGPT-4o is the model that made AI feel approachable. Warm, fast, genuinely multimodal with native voice at 320ms response time. The personality is eager and accommodating, sometimes to a fault. It wants to help. It will agree with you more than it should. For generalist tasks and non-technical teammates that’s a feature. For tasks where you need pushback, it’s a liability.\nGPT-4o mini is exactly what it sounds like: smaller, cheaper, faster. Good for high-volume, low-stakes tasks. Think of it the same way you’d think of Haiku. The executor, not the planner.\n**GPT-4o best for: **Real-time voice/multimodal applications, generalist tasks, non-technical audiences.\n**GPT-4o mini best for: **High-volume triage and classification. Nothing that requires sustained reasoning.\n## Gemini 2.5 Flash — Google’s Volume Tier\nPriced at $0.10 per million input tokens, the cheapest tier on this entire map. It’s the right answer for applications where latency is user-visible and cost compounds at scale. It’s not the most capable model in any dimension, but for the specific job of running fast and cheap, it does that job well.\n**Best for: **Real-time applications, high-throughput pipelines, anything deeply integrated with Google infrastructure.\n**Watch out for: **Complex reasoning tasks. This is a volume model, not a thinking model.\n## Bottom Right: Nothing Should Live Here\nI included this quadrant as a warning. A model that is slow, expensive, and not particularly deep is a product failure, not a positioning choice. If your evaluation process lands you here, paying a lot, waiting a long time, getting mediocre reasoning, something has gone wrong. Back up and start with the axes, not the benchmarks.\n## How to Actually Choose\nHere’s the decision tree I use when looking at a company’s AI stack in due diligence:\nStart in the top left. Sonnet 4.6, Gemini 3 Flash, or DeepSeek V3.1 should be your first stop. These cover 80–90% of real production use cases. If one of them works, you’re done.\nMove to the top right only when you have a specific reason. The reasoning specialists (o3, Opus 4.6, R1, Gemini 3 Pro) are not upgrades. They’re different tools for different jobs. Use them when accuracy matters more than speed, or when your context requirements are genuinely massive.\nRoute volume to the bottom left. Once you’ve validated quality at the higher tier, push high-volume, bounded tasks to Haiku, GPT-4o mini, or Gemini 2.5 Flash. The cost difference compounds fast at scale.\nData residency is a hard constraint, not a preference. If you’re in a regulated vertical, DeepSeek’s China residency may take it off the table regardless of pricing. Know this before you build on it.\nRun your own evals. This map is based on my experience across due diligence and portfolio work. Your use case is not my use case. The only signal that actually matters is how these models perform on your data, with your prompts, against your definition of correct. Everything else is prior.\nThe model family gets you in the right neighborhood. The tier gets you to the right building. Your evals tell you whether you’ve actually found what you’re looking for.\nChoose accordingly, and please, stop defaulting to Opus because it sounds more impressive.\nIf you want to argue about where something belongs on this map, or think I’ve got a tier wrong, I’m in. The stakes are too high to get this wrong and the space moves too fast to stay quiet about it.\n[\nArtificial Intelligence\n] \n[\nMachine Learning\n] \n[\nStartup\n] \n[\nSoftware Engineering\n] \n[\nTechnology\n] \n[\n![Emma Wirt] \n] \n[\n![Emma Wirt] \n] \n[## Written by Emma Wirt\n] \n[14 followers] \n·[6 following] \nProduct @ Fika Ventures.
